<h2>The reason this website exists</h2>

<p1>Although I <em>Technically</em> made a website (if you could even call it that) in the first year of college, compared that abomination of a site,</p1>
<br>
<p1>this is my first proper attempt.</p1>
<p1>During late 2020 / early 2021 (just coming out of the first lockdowns here in England)<br> I became heavily interested in Linux and more broadly the Free Software movement.</p1>
<br>
<p1>During this time I began watching lots of Linux related content on youtube, including <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>.</p1>
<br>
<p1>Over the next few months, I must have consumed most if not all of his videos, learnt lots about <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM</a>,</p1>
<br>
<p1>and infused my brain with endless obscure trivia. Sometime at the end of this youtube-binge I found Luke's video on setting up nginx,</p1>
<br>
<p1>and thought I'd salvadge something from my college project.</p1>
<br>
<p1>Anyway, I've left this site dormant for too long now, its time I actually add some content.</p1>
